#Course project Submission : Practical Machine Learning

###Loading Re quired packages
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
```

###Getting the data
The training data set can be found on the following URL:
```{r}
trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
```

The testing data set can be found on the following URL:
```{r}
testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
```

```{r}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```


###Partioning
Partioning Training data set into two data sets, 60% for myTraining, 40% for myTesting:

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

###Cleaning the data
The following transformations were used to clean the data:

Transformation 1: Cleaning NearZeroVariance Variables. Run this code to view possible NZV Variables:
```{r}

myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
```

Run this code to create another subset without NZV variables:

```{r}
myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
"kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
"max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
"var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
"stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
"kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
"max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
"kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
"skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
"amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
"skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
"max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
"amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
"avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
"stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")
```

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]
```

```{r}
dim(myTraining)
```

Transformation 2: Killing first column of Dataset - ID Removing first ID variable so that it does not interfer with ML Algorithms:

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```

Transformation 3: Cleaning Variables with too many NAs. For Variables that have more than a 60% threshold of NA’s I’m going to leave them out:

```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining
```

```{r}
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
        if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}
```

```{r}
dim(trainingV3)
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```

Now let us do the exact same 3 transformations but for our myTesting and testing data sets.

```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]
dim(myTesting)
dim(testing)
```

In order to ensure proper functioning of Decision Trees and especially RandomForest Algorithm with the Test data set (data set provided), we need to coerce the data into the same type.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
        for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
```

```{r}
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) 
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

Using ML algorithms for prediction: Decision Tree

```{r}
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
```

```{r}
fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)
```

###Predicting:

```{r}
predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")
```

Using confusion matrix to compare:

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
```

Using ML algorithms for prediction: Random Forests

```{r}
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=myTraining)
```

Predicting in-sample error:

```{r}
predictionsB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")
```

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictionsB1, myTesting$classe)
```

Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!

Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment:
Finally, using the provided Test Set out-of-sample error.

For Random Forests we use the following formula, which yielded a much better prediction in in-sample:

```{r}
predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
```

Function to generate files with predictions to submit for assignment

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
```

```{r}
pml_write_files(predictionsB2)
```

###THE END
